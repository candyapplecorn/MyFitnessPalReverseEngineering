Some methods for calculating one's calorie expenditure include the Katch McArdle, Harris-Benedict and Mifflin St Jeor  formulas, among many others. These make predictions about one's body based on measurable inputs such as height, age, gender, weight, body fat percentage and activity levels.

__They're just predictions though, and will never be perfectly accurate on a per-individual basis.__

MyFitnessPal Reverse Engineering aims to procure results more accurate than these formulas by using comprehensive historical data these formulas don't. It will reverse-engineer an individual's TDEE by analyzing historical data on net calories and weight measurements.
